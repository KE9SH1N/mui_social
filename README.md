## About The Project

This project is focused on learning and integrating Material UI (MUI) design within a React Next.js framework. The main objective is to create a social landing page by utilizing core MUI components, icons, and incorporating basic Tailwind CSS for styling.

It serves as a practice exercise to explore MUI's capabilities, understand how its components work in tandem with React, and experiment with different design elements to build a visually appealing and functional UI.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
